\section{Leaving on a Jet Plane} \label{sec:song1}
Words and Music by John Denver
\begin{verbatim}
       G     /     /     /   C    /   /   /
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
    G    /    /    /  C    /    /   /
I'm standing here outside your door
  G     /   /   /  C  /   /   /  D  ///////
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
        G     /   /       /    C  /   /   /
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
     G  /   /      /    C        /   /   /
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
  G  /   /   /  C  /    /   /   D  ///////
Already I'm so lonesome I could die


Chorus:
   G  /  /   /  C    /   /  /  
So kiss me and smile for me 
G    /   /    /     C    /   /   /
Tell me that you'll wait for me
G    /   /    /     C  /   /   /  D ///////
Hold me like you'll never let me go
           G / / /  C  /  /   /  
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
G  /    /     /  C    /    /    /  
 Don't know when I'll be back again
G  /  /  /  C    /   /   /  D ///////
        Oh, babe, I hate to go....

Verse 2:
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

CHORUS

Verse 3:
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

CHORUS

end on G chord

\section{The Gambler} \label{sec:song2}
words and music by Kenny Rogers
\begin{verbatim}
     G                          C               G
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
  C               G                C                 D
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   G                               C             G
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     C           G        D               G
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.

         G                             C                G
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
    C                  G                 C                   D
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       G                               C                 G
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      C             G            D             G
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."

     G                           C                  G
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
C                G             C              D
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
        G                                C                 G
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                 C                    G             D                G
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
           G                     C             G
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
C            G         C                D
know when to walk away and know when to run.
          G                            C              G
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
                 C          G        D                 G
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.


D                            C             G
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
   C              G           C                   D
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       G                         C              G
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
        C                 G              D           G
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."

    G                               C                       G
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
C               G             C            D
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    G                             C                 G
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    C            G                D                G
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

CHORUS 2x and end...

\section{Brown Eyed Girl} \label{sec:song3}
Words and music by Van Morrison
\begin{verbatim}
   G               C       G             D  
Hey, where did we go   days when the rain came
Whatever      happened to Tuesday and so slow

G              C         G               D     
Down in  the   hollow    playing    a   new game 
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio

G               C                 G              D         
Laughing and a running, hey hey   Skipping and a jumping
Standing in the sunlight laughing hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall

G              C            G           D
in the misty   morning fog, ah   with   our hearts a thumpin'
Slipping and a sliding     all along the waterfall

    C     D             G      Em
and you,  my brown eyed girl 
and you,  my brown eyed girl 

C      D           G     D
You, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
  
BRIDGE:
 
D
Do you remember when we used to sing
 
G         C           G              D
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  Just like that
 
G         C           G              D         G
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
VERSE 3:
So hard to find my way 
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
 
REPEAT BRIDGE AND END

           G                         
Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load
                     D     C
I've got seven women on my mind
G                       D
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
C                              G

            D        C

       G                 D
It's a girl my lord in a flat-bed Ford
        C                        G
Slowin' down to take a look at me
          Em              C G

Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find

\section{Mr Tambourine Man} \label{sec:song5}
The Byrds
\begin{verbatim}
Intro:
D   G   A

Chorus:
G           A               D               G
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
        D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G           A               D               G
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
       D             G       Em        A         D   G   D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

         G                  A          D                 G
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into the sand.
D                G             D               G
Vanished from my hand, left me blindly here to stand 
    Em        A
but still not sleeping!
   G          A             D             G      D              G
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet I have no one to meet.
        D             G            Em       A
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Chorus

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel the grip, 
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my onw parade cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it

Chorus

Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
seein' that he's chasing

Chorus

Then take me dissapearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightended trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wavin' free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate drive deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
\end{verbatim}
