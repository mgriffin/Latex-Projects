Words and Music by John Denver
\begin{verbatim}
       G     /     /     /   C    /   /   /
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
    G    /    /    /  C    /    /   /
I'm standing here outside your door
  G     /   /   /  C  /   /   /  D  ///////
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
        G     /   /       /    C  /   /   /
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
     G  /   /      /    C        /   /   /
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
  G  /   /   /  C  /    /   /   D  ///////
Already I'm so lonesome I could die


Chorus:
   G  /  /   /  C    /   /  /  
So kiss me and smile for me 
G    /   /    /     C    /   /   /
Tell me that you'll wait for me
G    /   /    /     C  /   /   /  D ///////
Hold me like you'll never let me go
           G / / /  C  /  /   /  
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
G  /    /     /  C    /    /    /  
 Don't know when I'll be back again
G  /  /  /  C    /   /   /  D ///////
        Oh, babe, I hate to go....

Verse 2:
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

CHORUS

Verse 3:
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

CHORUS

end on G chord

\section{The Gambler} \label{sec:song2}
words and music by Kenny Rogers
\begin{verbatim}
     G                          C               G
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
  C               G                C                 D
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   G                               C             G
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     C           G        D               G
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.

         G                             C                G
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
    C                  G                 C                   D
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       G                               C                 G
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      C             G            D             G
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."

     G                           C                  G
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
C                G             C              D
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
        G                                C                 G
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                 C                    G             D                G
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
           G                     C             G
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
C            G         C                D
know when to walk away and know when to run.
          G                            C              G
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
                 C          G        D                 G
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.


D                            C             G
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
   C              G           C                   D
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       G                         C              G
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
        C                 G              D           G
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."

    G                               C                       G
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
C               G             C            D
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    G                             C                 G
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    C            G                D                G
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

CHORUS 2x and end...

Words and music by Van Morrison
\begin{verbatim}
   G               C       G             D  
Hey, where did we go   days when the rain came
Whatever      happened to Tuesday and so slow

G              C         G               D     
Down in  the   hollow    playing    a   new game 
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio

G               C                 G              D         
Laughing and a running, hey hey   Skipping and a jumping
Standing in the sunlight laughing hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall

G              C            G           D
in the misty   morning fog, ah   with   our hearts a thumpin'
Slipping and a sliding     all along the waterfall

    C     D             G      Em
and you,  my brown eyed girl 
and you,  my brown eyed girl 

C      D           G     D
You, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
  
BRIDGE:

Do you remember when we used to sing
 
G         C           G              D
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  Just like that
 
G         C           G              D         G
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
VERSE 3:
So hard to find my way 
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
 
REPEAT BRIDGE AND END

The Byrds
\begin{verbatim}
Intro:
D   G   A

Chorus:
G           A               D               G
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
        D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G           A               D               G
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
       D             G       Em        A         D   G   D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

         G                  A          D                 G
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into the sand.
D                G             D               G
Vanished from my hand, left me blindly here to stand 
    Em        A
but still not sleeping!
   G          A             D             G      D              G
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet I have no one to meet.
        D             G            Em       A
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Chorus

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel the grip, 
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my onw parade cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it

Chorus

Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
seein' that he's chasing

Chorus

Then take me dissapearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightended trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wavin' free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate drive deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
\end{verbatim}

\section{The House of the Rising Sun} \label{sec:song6}
Bob Dylan
\begin{verbatim}
Am C D F   Am E Am E 

      Am   C        D           F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E   E7
They call the rising sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am     E         Am    C D F   Am E Am E 

And God, I know, I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my old blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's ever satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

              *Solo*

Oh, mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know, I'm one...

Am        F                            G 
 If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a grey guitar and play 
C     F          G 
 Mr. Jones and me look into the future 
C            F 
 Stare at the beautiful women 
  G 
She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me. 
C               F         G 
 Standing in the spotlight I bought myself a grey guitar 
C              F           G                  Am 
 When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely 
                  G 
I will never be lonley 
Am         G 
 I will never be lonley 
Am 
 I want to be a lion 
G 
 Everybody wants to pass as cats 
Am 
 We all want to be big big stars, 
G 
 But we got diffrent reasons for that. 
Am 
 Believe in me because 
G 
 I don't believe in anything 
Am                   G 
 And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe. 
C   F            G 
 Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio 
C                    F 
 Yeah we stare at the beautiful women 
G 
 She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be Somebody for me. 
C                  F 
 I want to be Bob Dylan  
G 
 Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky 
C                F 
 When everybody loves you, son, 
G 
 that's just about as funky as you can be. 
C     F          G 
 Mr. Jones and me staring at the video 
C          F 
 When I look at the television, 
G 
 I want to see me staring right back at me. 
C                 F 
 We all want to be big stars, 
         G 
but we don't know why, and we don't know how. 
C                  F 
 But when everybody loves me, 
 G 
I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be. 
C         F            G 
 Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars...

G    D    Em7      Am            C 

A long long time ago I can still remember 
         Em                    D         G      D        Em7 
How that music used to make me smile and I knew if I had my chance 
    Am                  C                Em              C          D   Em 

That I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while 
             Am             Em               Am 
But February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver 
C        G/B    Am            C              D 

Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step 
  G       D           Em           Am7            D 
I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride 
    G         D              Em            C       D7    G    C/G   G 

But something touched me deep inside the day the music died          So 

G   C          G      D 
Bye Bye Miss American Pie 
         G            C             G         D 

Drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry 
         G        C                  G           D 
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
        Em                        A7   Em                        D7 

Singin' this'll be the day that I die, this'll be the day that I die. 
 G                 Am                  C                Am 
Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above? 
Em           D                 G     D        Em 

If the Bible tells you so.  Do you believe in Rock 'n Roll? 
    Am7             C 
Can music save your mortal soul?  
    Em                A7           D 
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 
        Em                  D 

Well, I know that you're in love with him  
           Em              D 
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym 
    C           G/B      A7           C                    D7 
You both kicked off your shoes man, I dig those rhythm and blues 
        G       D       Em 

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck  
        Am                  C 
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck. 
    G      D     Em              C       D7    G    C 

But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died    I started singin' 

(Chorus) 
G                            Am 
Now for ten years we've been on our own  
    C                   Am              Em                    D 
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,  but that's not how it used to be 
         G      D            Em 

When the jester sang for the King and Queen 
     Am7              C 
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean  
      Em         A7        D 
And a voice that came from you and me 
        Em                 D                 Em               D 

Oh, and while the King was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown 
    C         G/B     A7        C             D7 
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned 
          G      D      Em                Am                C 

And while Lennon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park 
    G        D     Em               C       D7    G    C 
And we sang dirges in the dark, the day the music died.   We were singing 

(Chorus) 
G                   Am 

Helter-Skelter in a summer swelter,  
        C                     Am 
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter 
Em                   D               G      D        Em 
Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul out on the grass 
    Am7           C 

The players tried for a forward pass  
             Em       A7          D 
But the jester's on the sidelines in a cast 
        Em                D 
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume  
          Em                 D 

While the sergeants played a marching tune 
C      G/B       A7             C        D7 
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance 
           G       D        Em              

'Cause the players tried to take the field  
    Am         C 
The marching band refused to yield 
G      D      Em                    C       D7    G  C  G 

Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?   We stared singing 

(Chorus) 
G                         Am             C          Am 
Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space 
Em                   D                         G 
With no time left to start again.  So come on, Jack be nimble 

Em                 Am7            C 
Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick  
        Em         A7            D 
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend 
        Em               D 

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage,  
    Em                    D 
My hands were clenched in fists of rage 
C        G       A7         C                  D7 
No angel born in hell could break that Satan's spell 
           G              D     Em 

And as the flames climbed high into the night  
   Am             C 
To light the sacrificial rite 
      G     D        Em                C      D7     G  C  G 

I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died    He was singing 

(Chorus) 
  G                       Am          C                  Am 
I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news 
    Em                         D      G                       D 

But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store 
          Em              Am7 
Where I'd heard the music years before  
        Em                 A7             D 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play 
           Em                   D 

And in the streets the children screamed  
     Em                         D 
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed 
C         G        A7          C                     D7 
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken 
    G           D                Em      Am          C 

And three men I admire most, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
     G          D          Em 
They caught the last train for the coast, 
    C       D7    G    C  G  D7 

The day the music died.      And they were singing 
(Chorus) 

D7 
They were singing 
G    C        G        D 
Bye, bye Miss American Pie  
         G            C            G        D 

Drove my Chevy to the Levy but the levy was dry 
         G        C                  G           D 
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye 
        C                D7         G   C G 

singin' this will be the day that I die.
