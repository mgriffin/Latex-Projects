\section*{11th August 2013}

Climbing in Dalkey with Louise. Nice day but overcast.

\subsection*{Prealpine}

Louise led up and I seconded. We set up a belay at the top and rapelled down. I
climbed it again on top rope and dismantled the belay before coming back down to
decide where to go next.

\subsection*{Mahjong}

I led up with some encouragement from onlookers. First ever lead and I just had 
to remember to place gear when I got to the easier sections. That and not fall
off, obviously. Made it to the top and set up a belay for Louise to come up. Took
my time to make sure I got it right. Dismantled everything and walked around to 
the bottom to get our gear and go home.
